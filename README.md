# Electronic Voting System

### Hey! This is Akshata A Bhat! 

#### This is my project developed for Microsoft Engage 2022. This is an electronic voting machine based on an Ethereum Blockchain with Face Recognition Authentication.

## 1. Face Recognition:

### I have developed a GUI-based application for face recognition.
### To run the code for face recognition:

```bash
  git clone {Face Recognition folder}
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Face Recognition
```

Install requirements

```bash
  pip install -r  requirements.txt
```

Run The python file 

```bash
  python app-gui.py
```
#### The model captures 300 images of the user's face and stores it in the folder by the user's name. Then the model is trained based on the captured images. Then, the model predicts the face based on the trained model.
